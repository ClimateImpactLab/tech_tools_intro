Phase 1: Simulation of Climate Impact Models
--------------------------------------------

* Inputs: CSVV's and some Weather Data

* Processed via a python script that queues up:

* Monte Carlo Simulation

  * Lots of combinations: 95% confidence interval simulation for every Climate model, Climate scenario, Economic Model and Economic Scenario. 

* Median Diagnostic Simulation
 
  * Simulation of every Climate model, Climate Scenario, Economic model and economic scenario at p =.5


* Outputs: Damage estimates in for binned data by region in .csv format
