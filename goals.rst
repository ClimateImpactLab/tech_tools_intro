Goals of Data API
-----------------

We'll be building out a Data API to provide structure and reasoning around the organization of data. We are doing this for a number of reasons.

1. Automatic documentation of process: If we think in terms of data pipelines and analytical cycles, a system that helps us easily document and describe data expedites the information feedback of the analytical cycle. 

2. Attribution/Citation: A data trail tracking ingestion, modification, and use throughout the analytical cycle

3. Reproducibility: Everyone can easily understand how data and analysis led to certain outputs

4. Clarity/Usability/Resilience: With this kind of transparency, the data, and its documentation explicitly represent the process, Knowledge becomes generally available and usable. 

5. Optimization: Researchers can spend time on research as opposed to searching for data, its origin, and its purpose.
