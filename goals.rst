Goals for the Climate Impact Lab Workflow
---------------------------------------------------

Our analysis should have the following qualities:

1. **Transparent** 

    It is important that researchers across the team and in the wider scientific & economic communities understand and feel comfortable with our methods.

2. **Reproducibile**

    We need to version and document code & data so we can reproduce past results.

3. **Clear, Usable, and Resilient**

    We have a lot of team members and a lot of research going on. Documentation is critical to ensuring a long project life!

4. **Maintain Attribution**

    We need to maintain a data trail tracking ingestion, modification, and use of source data throughout the analytical cycle

5. **Efficient**

    Use industry standard tools so researchers can spend time on research!
