Introduction 
------------


This is a reference to general best practices and ideas. This is also a starting point for our discussion about tools you will use. We will cover alot of ground in our discussion so this is simply for your future reference. 



.. _BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/ClimateImpactLab/
.. _Github: https://github.com/ClimateImpactLab
.. _MetaCSV: https://github.com/ClimateImpactLab/MetaCSV

You'll want to know about these two repos:

Bitbucket_ is a private repo and home to most of the code used to during :doc:`Phase -1 <phase_neg1>`, :doc:`Phase 1 <phase_1>`, and :doc:`Phase 2 <phase_2>`. There is a great deal of documentation there. You should all have access to this repo. If you do not, please let me know. 

Github_ is home to our public github repo and the place where we'll be storing most of our public facing tools like MetaCSV_. 

So what's the difference? If you are working on code to be shared among your team or internally, its probably going to Bitbucket_. If you are collaborating on an open-source public-facing tool that you want the larger community to use then its probably going to Github_.
