Welcome to the Climate Impact Lab!
----------------------------------

The CIL ingests and produces lots of data. That data enters the system from a variety of primary sources. You, the RAs, take that and turn it into valuable analysis. Your analysis is a data output that serves as an input into other analytical process, either internally within your research teams or to the greater CIL team and beyond. 

At any given moment there is a tremendous amount of data moving around the system. Researchers are building data sets from primary sources. Or they may be loading data from our servers on Shackleton or Griffin. Or they may be running analytical models and writing outputs to files on Shackleton or Griffin. 

Knowing the state of your data, its provenance and its purpose is important. This is true not only for your own use but anyone else who you may be working with now and in the future.
