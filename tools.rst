Tools for code development
---------------------------

.. _git: https://git-scm.com/
.. _BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/ClimateImpactLab/
.. _Github: https://github.com/ClimateImpactLab
.. _MetaCSV: https://github.com/ClimateImpactLab/MetaCSV

At the Climate Impact Lab we use `git`_ for version control. Git is a system for tracking changes to code (or any text files) across teams.

We host our code on one of two sites: 


* Bitbucket_ is for private repos and is the home for most of the ImpactLab code.You should all have access to this repo. If you do not, please let me know. 

* Github_ is home to our public github repos and the place where we'll be storing most of our public facing tools like MetaCSV_. 

So what's the difference? If you are working on code to be shared among your team or internally, its probably going to Bitbucket_. If you are collaborating on an open-source public-facing tool that you want the larger community to use then its probably going to Github_. 



Basic intro to git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure that you have `git`_ installed and that you have an account on Github_ and BitBucket_, and that your `SSH Keys have been registered <https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-ssh-for-git-728138079.html>`_ with both of these sites. We can help you with this.

**Creating a repository**

1. Decide on a descriptive name for your project, and create a new repository on Github or BitBucket under the appropriate Project & Team names. If the appropriate team name doesn't exist let `Justin <https://climateimpactlab.slack.com/messages/@jsimcock/>`_ or `Mike <https://climateimpactlab.slack.com/messages/@mdelgado/>`_ know.

2. Follow the instructions on uploading a new project.

**Cloning and using an existing repository**

1. Navigate to the repository's page on Github or Bitbucket and copy the "clone repo" link.

2. In your terminal window, enter ``git clone <url>``, replacing ``<url>`` with the one you copied from the site.
